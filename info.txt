**THE CONGRESS**

In recent times, the burden of disease outbreak in developing countries is high. Most of the technologies developed and deployed tend not to specifically address the health problems in developing countries. However, developing countries are beginning to undertake innovative approaches to create simple and cost effective indigenous technologies to address their fundamental health problems.
The 5th international congress on Health Sciences and Technology therefore provides the platform for academics, scientists, policy makers, industrialists and other stakeholders to discuss innovative indigenous technologies for health promotion and Health Management in Nigeria and other developing countries.
